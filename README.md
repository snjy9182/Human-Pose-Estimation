# Human Pose Estimation From COCO
We present implementations of the three aforementioned architectures, DeepPose, Chained Prediction, and Stacked Hourglass as well as our own architecture, the Residual Stacked Hourglass. The implementation we present uses the open-source [PyTorch framework by Jain and Shah](https://github.com/Naman-ntc/Pytorch-Human-Pose-Estimation) that provides excellent training and test codes with the PCK performance metric. We also use the COCO dataloader provided by Microsoftâ€™s implementation of [Simple Baselines for Human Pose Estimation and Tracking](https://github.com/Microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch) and we also use Cython integration for Pytorch from [Faster R-CNN]( https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn).  For our compute, we use a Chrome Remote Desktop with a virtual instance hosted on the Google Cloud Platform for training and optimization with a NVIDIA Tesla P100.
